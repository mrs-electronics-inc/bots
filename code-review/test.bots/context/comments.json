    "body": "# Review\nNo change requests.\n## Summary of Changes\n- Updated the code review bot Docker image version in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.\n- Adjusted background color in web manifests for both `cc` and `sz` apps to match the login page nav bar gray.\n- Modified viewport meta tag in `index.html` to disable user scaling for improved mobile UX.\n- Minor formatting cleanup in `index.html` regarding `<noscript>` content.\n- Added artifact collection paths for code review outputs.\n\n## Overall Feedback\nLooking at this MR, I can see you're working on PWA improvements for mobile UX, particularly focusing on visual consistency and control. @aemig_mrs \n\nThe changes seem straightforward - updating manifest colors, disabling user scaling, and adding some padding. üëç\n\nI noticed there are some binary image files changed but no actual code changes shown in the diffs for those. The web manifest and HTML changes look good from a functionality standpoint!\n\nLet me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to focus on during this test of the new code review bot setup! üöÄ",
